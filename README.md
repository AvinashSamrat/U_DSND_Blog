## Motivation
As per Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree project, I was asked to write a Data science blogpost using CRISP-DM. I was intriguted to analyze and find business related questions about airbnb listings for Boston. The main motivation to complete this project was to doing my first project for Udacity.
